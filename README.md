# Utility tools to create panoramas

Work in progress. Here I share scripts that support me to create panoramas.
My panorama tour viewer: https://github.com/NiHoel/cirspecte

## tiling_hdr.bat
1. Install Blender: https://www.blender.org/download/
2. Open tiling_hdr.bat in a text editor and make sure that it uses the correct path for blender
3. Drop a .exr or .hdr file onto tiling_hdr.bat
4. A new folder is created that can be imported by cirspecte
